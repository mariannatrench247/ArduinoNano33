# Basic Workflow 
1. Train model using full TF on computer / server
2. Convert model into TF lite flat buffer file (.tflite) 
3. convert to array in language of choice for microcontrollers 
## INDEX :  
### 1. Working with Sensors
### 2. Using BLE 
### 3. Machine Learning on BLE Sense 
### 4. Memory Allocation 
### 5. Assigning, Mitigating Tasks to Optimize Processing Capabilites on Microcontrollers
